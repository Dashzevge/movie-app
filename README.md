# Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation

One thing I found really interesting was setting up state management with a custom `useDebounce` hook. It was cool to see how debouncing helped cut down the number of API calls while typing, which made the search feature much smoother and faster. It felt great to see the improvement in responsiveness with just a bit of extra code!

# Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation

I’m especially proud of how I handled API management with a middleware that takes care of the token for all requests. It’s a straightforward solution but super efficient—everything just works seamlessly, and it’s nice to know that the requests are secure and well-managed.

# Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?

If I had more time, I’d love to add user features like a login page, registration, and a user dashboard to track what they've watched. I’d also aim to make the site a full-fledged streaming platform, where users can watch movies and trailers directly. That would really take the project to the next level!



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
